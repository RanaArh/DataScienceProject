# DataScienceProject
This repository contains the implementation and findings of my final semester project for the course Advanced Techniques in Data Science. The project focuses on applying data mining techniques to analyze and extract valuable insights from educational data. 

**Problem Statement:**

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and predict the pass/fail status of students enrolled in a Data Mining course at FAST National University. The dataset contains detailed marks from quizzes, assignments, and sessional exams, provided by the course instructor.

The challenge is to preprocess the data, explore patterns, and build a robust predictive model using Logistic Regression. The model aims to:

Identify significant factors influencing student performance.
Accurately classify students as either "Pass" or "Fail" based on their performance metrics.
Provide actionable insights for educators to support at-risk students and improve course outcomes.
This project requires maintaining data confidentiality and focusing on achieving high accuracy while providing meaningful interpretations of the results.
